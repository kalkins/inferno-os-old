Virtual RISC-V kernel

This kernel is used to test the port to RISC-V in an easily debuggable environment, and without dealing with specific hardware.

VirtIO drivers were implemented to test how the kernel worked with input and output. The drivers are generic, and should work on other architectures.

The kernel can be run on QEMU with screen, hard drive and input devices using the following command:

qemu-system-riscv32 -M virt -m 64M -d guest_errors,unimp -kernel ivirtriscv -serial stdio -drive if=none,format=raw,file=hdd.img,id=hdd -device virtio-blk-device,scsi=off,drive=hdd -device virtio-gpu-device -device virtio-keyboard-device -device virtio-mouse-device
